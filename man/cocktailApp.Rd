\description{
A \code{shiny} app to explore cocktails. The app allows you to enter ingredients
that a cocktail must have, or ingredients that it must not have. One can
filter by number of ingredients, minimum rating, minimum \sQuote{t stat}
(computed as the rating minus the T stat zero all multiplied by the square
root of the number of ratings). One can also search for cocktail by regex.

In the main tab, titled \dQuote{drinks}, one can find a table with the
summaries of matching cocktails. Selecting rows of this table will
cause the cocktail table below to be populated with more details on each
selected cocktail. Selecting rows will also populate the bar chart
in the \dQuote{plots} tab.

If two or more ingredients are selected, drinks with non-zero quantities
of both of these will be shown in a ternary plot in the \dQuote{tern}
tab. 

In the \dQuote{other} tab is a table with common co-ingredients of the
selected ingredients. A co-ingredient is an ingredient that commonly
occurs with the selected ingredient, as measured by the number of
cocktails, and by \sQuote{rho}, which is like a correlation based
on the proportion.
